The file has to have this structure:
Work group
GenealogyID	ExtendToChildren
GenealogyID	ExtendToChildren
GenealogyID	ExtendToChildren
...

Ex:
QCInspector_WG
BRC0001TMH0000	True
BRC0003BMXB34	False
...

If ExtendToChildren is False, all aliquots that start with that genealogyId will be blocked.
If ExtendToChildren is True, all aliquots that start with that genealogyId and their children will be blocked.


To delete all samples (aliquot, mice, cell lines) related, the keyword "Delete" is required in place of work group name.

Ex:
Delete
BRC0001TMH0000	True
BRC0003BMXB34	False
